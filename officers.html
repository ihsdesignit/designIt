        <h2> Vanya Rohatgi, Cofounder </h2>
        <p> Vanya is the proud cofounder and copresident of Design.it! She started learning HTML and CSS in 8th grade, and moved on to JavaScript her freshman year. She has built many personal websites and has also released her first iPhone app, Wander, on the iTunes App Store. Her favorite thing to do on weekends is go to hackathons and build cool stuff. She is so excited to share her skills with Design.it club members!</p>
        <h2> Emily Chin, Cofounder </h2>
        <p> Emily is excited to serve as Design.It's copresident for the 2017-2018 school year. She started learning about web development her sophomore year and became more serious about it junior year, taking her skills to hackathons. She is marveled by the impact technology has on society and wants to be a part of the community that builds it. Aside from coding, Emily loves sewing, watching K-dramas, and drinking boba (maybe everyday). </p>
        <h2> Christina Huang, VP </h2>
        <p> Christina is a senior this year and is so excited to be your Vice President. She enjoys messing around with code to make things match an aesthetic so this club is the ideal creative outlet. She harbors an undeniable fondness for art. One of her favorite pastimes is touring art museums and doing studies of famous paintings, like Monet’s Japanese Bridge. Astronomy and theoretical physics captivate her. In addition to art and science, she is passionate about film. Kubrick’s <i> 2001: A Space Odyssey </i> was especially profound to her because it explored the nature of human consciousness and evolution. She hopes that everyone in this club will have a webpage they're proud of by the end of the year.</p>
        <h2> Neha Bashyam, Treasurer </h2>
        <p> Neha, the treasurer of Design.it, is a senior at Irvington. She began learning how to code for fun during her junior year and fell in love with it. Ever since, she’s learned how to code in programming languages such as Python and C++. In her opinion, coding is simply finding the fastest and most efficient way to solve an actual problem. Although some may be put off by the task of debugging their code, Neha believes that the satisfaction of having a working program makes up for all of the frustration. Besides coding, Neha enjoys listening to music, singing, hiking, and spending time with her friends. </p>
        <h2> Annika Yong, Secretary </h2>
        <p> Annika is the secretary of the Design.it club and the IHS Girls in STEM club. Influenced by her father, who tells her about the fascinating technological projects he works on, she develops a curiosity in STEM related subjects. She likes to code (occasionally), and daydreams (all the time). </p>
        <h2> Coco Yeung, Publicist </h2>
        <p> Coco Yeung is a senior in Irvington High School. She is passionate about art and design. She loves different kinds of art like drawing, painting, photography, and graphic designs. Coco always looks for new kinds of creativity, so she joined the club to try something new and fascinating. She has been told about programming since she was young from her father, but she never had a chance to try it. This club gives Coco a chance to explore the wonders of programming, and benefits her future career. Being the publicist of the club, Coco can combine graphic design and programming together. She will create artistic posters and use social media to publicize the club in order to get people acquainted with programming. </p>
